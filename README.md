# Website---AB-Testing-
For this project, I would like to check the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website based on datasets including two file: ab_data.csv and countries.csv.
The objective of this A/B testing is to make an important decision: whether the company should keep the old page or change to new page in regards of better conversion rate.
I would like to use Python with methods of statistics including probability, A/B Testing and Multiple regression
